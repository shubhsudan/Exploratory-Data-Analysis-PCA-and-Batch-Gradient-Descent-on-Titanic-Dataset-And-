# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-PCA-and-Batch-Gradient-Descent-on-Titanic-Dataset

# Project Description
## This project contains a comprehensive data science assignment utilizing the Titanic passengers dataset. The analysis covers:


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using summary statistics and visualizations. 

Application of dimensionality reduction techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). 

Implementation of batch gradient descent for linear regression. 

Reflection on generative AI methods for synthetic data generation. 

# Files
The main files required for this project are:

AI_610_Problem_Set_4_Matthew_and_Shubh.ipynb: The completed Jupyter Notebook containing all the executed code and results.

Titanic-Dataset.csv.xls: The dataset file required by the notebook.
syethetic_titanic.csv: Dataset file synthetically generated using LLM.


# How to Run
To replicate the analysis, follow these three steps:

### 1. Upload Datasets: Ensure the Titanic-Dataset.csv.xls file is in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook file (AI_610_Problem_Set_4_Matthew_and_Shubh-2.ipynb).

### 2. Install Libraries: Install all necessary libraries as listed in the notebook's initial import cell (see Python in the requirement.txt file).

### 3. Execute Notebook: Open the AI_610_Problem_Set_4_Matthew_and_Shubh-2.ipynb notebook and run all cells sequentially from top to bottom. The code snippets are designed to run as-is.
